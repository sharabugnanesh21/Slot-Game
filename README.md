# Slot-Game
Slot Machine Game:
This is a simple slot machine game implemented in Python. The game uses emojis as symbols and allows the user to bet a certain amount of virtual money and spin the slot machine. If the symbols on the slot machine match, the user wins a certain amount of money. If the symbols do not match, the user loses one dollar. The game continues until the user chooses to cash out or runs out of money.
